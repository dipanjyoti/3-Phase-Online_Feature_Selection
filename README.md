# 3-Phase-Online Feature Selection

The developed method is a group based selection approach and applied a three-phase filtering process to select the appropriate features. The first phase is an evolutionary-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique that applies to the group of incoming features in a multi-objective framework. The second phase checks the redundancy of features selected in the current group to the already selected features and finally, the third phase findsthe features in the already selected feature list that becomes non-significant on the selection of newlyarrived features and discards them.
